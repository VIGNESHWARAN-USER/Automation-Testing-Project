  As a receptionist or patient
  I want to download OPD visit reports
  So that I can have a physical or digital copy of the bill/details

  Background:
    Given the user is logged into the Smart Hospital portal as a receptionist
    And the user is on the "OPD - Out Patient" page

  Scenario: Download a patient's OPD bill report
    When the user clicks the "Show" icon for that patient
    And navigates to the "Visits" tab
    And clicks the "Print" icon on a specific visit record
    Then the report should be downloaded successfully
